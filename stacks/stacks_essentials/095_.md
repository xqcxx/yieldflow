<summary>Build an image locally and use it</summary>

* Clone the stacks-core repository (or a fork) and checkout the desired branch.

```
git clone git@github.com:stacks-network/stacks-core.git
cd stacks-core
git checkout develop
```

* Build the Docker image `stacks-node:local`:

```
docker build -t stacks-node:local -f ./Dockerfile ./

```
docker run -d -e REGISTRY_HTTP_ADDR=0.0.0.0:5001 -p 5001:5001 --name registry registry:2
docker tag stacks-node:local localhost:5001/stacks-node:local
docker push localhost:5001/stacks-node:local
```
